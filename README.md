# Animals and Trees

Animal Classification Using Tree-Based Methods
Master’s Degree Project (Italy)

This repository contains a machine learning project developed as part of a Master’s degree program at an Italian university. The project focuses on animal classification using tree-based models.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and evaluate tree-based classification techniques applied to animal-related datasets. Tree models are widely used in supervised learning due to their interpretability, robustness, and effectiveness on structured data.

The project demonstrates how these methods can be used to classify animals based on a set of descriptive features.

# Methodology

The classification task is approached using decision tree–based algorithms, which may include:

Decision Trees

Random Forests

Other ensemble tree methods

The workflow generally includes:

Data preprocessing and feature selection

Model training

Model evaluation and comparison

Analysis of classification performance
